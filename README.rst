About This Plugin
=================

This plugin supercharges the familiar Vim ``star`` (``*``) and ``#`` search
commands and adds the following features:

- Search across newlines.

  - You can select text spanning a line break and search that.

- Search without regard for whitespace.

  - A search for ``"foo  bar   baz"`` will match ``"foo bar baz"``.

  - You can toggle this effect on and off (the toggle defaults
    to ``<Leader>ds`` (``\ds``)).

- Search variations of multiple-word identifiers (multi-case).

  - A search for ``foo-bar``, ``fooBar`` or ``foo_bar`` will find
    all of these case variations.

  - You can toggle this effect to be always-on, always-off,
    or to use the default behavior (the toggle defaults to
    ``<Leader>dc`` (``\dc``)).

  - By default, only ``<F8>`` and ``<Enter>`` enable multi-case.

    If you run ``\dc`` once, you'll enable multi-case for all
    search commands. And if you run it again, you'll disable
    multi-case for all commands. Run a third time to reset
    the default behavior (where only ``<F8>`` and ``<Enter>``
    enable multi-case.)

- Momentarily blink the match under the cursor.

  - Depending on your Vim *colorscheme*, especially the cursor shape
    and its color compared to the match highlight color, it might be
    difficult to spot the cursor while matching. This blink feature
    can help!

  - You can toggle this effect on and off (the toggle defaults
    to ``<Leader>dB`` (``\dB``)).

- Center the cursor line vertically.

  - When you advance the cursor to the next match, some of the plugin
    commands will reposition the cursor line in the middle of the window.

    - But not all of them â€” it depends on which map command you use.

      By default, ``g*``, ``g#``, ``n`` and ``N`` will call ``zz`` to center the
      line in the window.

      But not the commands ``*``, ``#``, ``<F1>``, ``<S-F1>``, ``<F3>``, ``<S-F3>``,
      ``<F8>``, or ``<Enter>``.

    - You can also easily configure the plugin to not do this, or to
      choose different keybindings.

      See `User Configuration`_ for details on how to
      pick your own command maps.

This plugins maps a number of F-keys and other keys to help you search:

- Start a search using ``<F1>`` and ``<Shift-F1>``. ``<F1>`` is similar to using
  ``g*`` and will jump to the next match. ``<S-F1>`` is similar to using
  ``*`` and stays put.

  Advance to the next match using ``<F3>`` and ``<Shift-F3>`` instead of ``n`` and ``N``.

  Start a multi-case search using ``<F8>`` or ``<Enter>`` (or toggle that feature
  always-on with ``\dc``).

  You can use any of the F-key commands from visual mode to start a new
  search.

  See the table under `Search Commands`_ for more details
  about how these commands each work, and how they differ from one another.

Inspiration
===========

.. |vim-slash| replace:: ``junegunn/vim-slash``
.. _vim-slash: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-slash

The newline and whitespace features are inspired by a classic Vim tip:

https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_for_visually_selected_text

The blinky feature is inspired by a Stack Exchange answer that the
author happened to run across (and that only has 5 upvotes! But it's
way cooler than that =):

https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/8851/interrupting-blink-highlighting-function-if-mapping-is-invoked-again/13551#13551

- Their post is based on Damian Conway's work, ``die_blinkÃ«nmatchen.vim``,
  as found in *More Instantly Better Vim - OSCON 2013*.

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHm36-na4-4

- Albeit since then the ``die_blinkÃ«nmatchen.vim`` feature has been
  replaced by a much more concise blink function, which has been
  lovingly grifted from |vim-slash|_.

The `multi-word identifier
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)#Multiple-word_identifiers>`__
feature is my creation, because sometimes I work on React code where
variables have multiple identities (e.g., ``embraceVim`` and ``embrace-vim``)
and I got annoyed after about the fifth time I hand-typed something like
``embrace.\?vim`` so that I could search both at the same time.

- Though I "borrowed" the case filters from `tpope/vim-abolish
  <https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish>`__ (it's only 19 lines of code,
  but it's 19 lines of regexp which is, like, 19 hours of work ;).
  Thank you, Tim Pope!

Search Commands
===============

.. |vim-search-commands| replace:: ``:help search-commands``
.. _vim-search-commands: https://vimhelp.org/pattern.txt.html#search-commands

In stock Vim, ``*``, ``#``, ``g*``, ``g#``, ``/``, and ``?`` start a buffer search. You can then
advance to the next match using ``n`` (forward match) and ``N`` (backward match).

- Refer to |vim-search-commands|_ for more details on the builtin search commands.

This plugin modifies ``*``, ``#``, ``g*``, and ``g#`` as described below, and it
adds a number of additional commands.

It's also easy to choose your own key sequences for the commands listed
below. See the next section for more: `User Configuration`_

.. _after-plugin: https://github.com/embrace-vim/vim-blinky-search/blob/release/after/plugin/vim-blinky-search.vim

If you'd like to define your own maps, set the disable flag, and then
call the create-map functions from your own config.

- First, set the disable flag from your config:

  .. code-block::

    let g:blinky_search_disable = 1

- Then call the map setup commands from your config.

  Consult the |after-plugin|_ script to see how this
  plugin configures all the commands listed above.

  You could simply copy that file and modify it to taste.

  Or, you could copy the following and edit it to your liking:

  .. code-block::

    " Wire various command to start search with different behavior
    call g:embrace#blinky_search#CreateMaps_GStarSearch('<F1>')
    call g:embrace#blinky_search#CreateMaps_StarSearchStayPut('<S-F1>')

    " These two commands also enable multicase matching by default
    call g:embrace#blinky_search#CreateMaps_GStarSearchStayPut('<F8>')
    call g:embrace#blinky_search#CreateMaps_ToggleHighlight('<CR>')

    " Wire two F-key commmands to next/prev match
    call g:embrace#blinky_search#CreateMaps_SearchForward('<F3>')
    call g:embrace#blinky_search#CreateMaps_SearchBackward('<S-F3>')

    " Wire '*' and '#' from visual mode
    call g:embrace#blinky_search#CreateMaps_StarPound_VisualMode()

    " Wire the three feature toggles
    call g:embrace#blinky_search#CreateMaps_ToggleBlinking('<Leader>dB')
    call g:embrace#blinky_search#CreateMaps_ToggleMulticase('<Leader>dc')
    call g:embrace#blinky_search#CreateMaps_ToggleStrict('<Leader>ds')

    " Change builtins to also center match line with `zz`
    call g:embrace#middle_matches#CreateMaps(['n', 'N', '*', '#', 'g*', 'g#'])

    " Hide highlights with <Ctrl-H>

  - ``vim-blinky-search`` wires a hide-highlight command you can use
    (which defaults to ``<Ctrl-H>``), but if you'd like a more automated
    solution that hides when you move the cursor or leave insert mode,
    check out ``junegunn/vim-slash`` or ``pgdouyon/vim-evanesco``.

Installation
============

.. |help-packages| replace:: ``:h packages``
.. _help-packages: https://vimhelp.org/repeat.txt.html#packages

.. |INSTALL.md| replace:: ``INSTALL.md``
.. _INSTALL.md: INSTALL.md

Take advantage of Vim's packages feature (|help-packages|_)
and install under ``~/.vim/pack``, e.g.,:

.. code-block::

  mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/embrace-vim/start
  cd ~/.vim/pack/embrace-vim/start
  git clone https://github.com/embrace-vim/vim-blinky-search.git

  " Build help tags
  vim -u NONE -c "helptags vim-blinky-search/doc" -c q

- Alternatively, install under ``~/.vim/pack/emrace-vim/opt`` and call
  ``:packadd vim-blinky-search`` to load the plugin on-demand.

For more installation tips â€” including how to easily keep the
plugin up-to-date â€” please see |INSTALL.md|_.
