" Automatically center curson on search
" -------------------------------------------------------------------------
"  [2018-06-11: Just created this. I am so behind the Vim-times!]

" How did I not Google this before? Such an obvious feature!
" NOTE: You could :set scrolloff=999 to keep the cursor centered, but then
"       it applies not just to every command, but to the whole interaction.
"       I.e., the cursor will always be centered! You won't be able to arrow-
"       up, arrow-down, Ctrl-PgUp, etc. to move the cursor outside the middle.
"       So that's not an option.
" Use `zz` after search commands to center the cursor, so your eye doesn't
" have to scan to see where where the cursor is. Also, if you have more than
" one search result highlighted in view, and if your syntax colors sometimes
" make it difficult to see upon which highlight is the cursor is situated,
" centering the cursor makes it obvious.

function g:embrace#middle_matches#CreateMaps() abort
  " BLARGH/2018-06-13: The n/N maps do not stick. You can set manually and they
  " work, but something is clobbering them on startup...
  " - Ha! I even put these two lines at the bottom and ~/.vimrc, and it still
  "   doesn't stick!
  " - As suspected: You can map another key, e.g., m/M, and it'll stick to them.
  " DISABLE/MAYBE/2018-06-13: I feel weird leaving this code uncommented, because
  "   it doesn't work; however, I'd like to see if it even magically starts working
  "   again...
  nnoremap n nzz
  nnoremap N Nzz
  " WHATEVER/2018-06-13: So be it! We can map Alt-n/N, at least in the GUI; in the
  "   terminal, I think I'm stuck with */#.
  nnoremap <M-n> nzz
  nnoremap <M-N> Nzz

  nnoremap * *zz
  nnoremap # #zz
  " (lb): Ha. I don't use the g-commands. g* is like '*' but without \<word\>
  " boundaries. And g# is like '#" (reverse-'*'), but without word boundaries.
  nnoremap g* g*zz
  nnoremap g# g#zz

  " Meh. If you find other instances where you want to enable the centering
  " behavior, you could add a toggle command. But I think I've got all the
  " bases covered that I care about. (And I'm not a sports fan, so not sure
  " why the baseball reference.)
